\begin{Problem}
Prove that a set with an uncountable subset is itself uncountable.

\problemAnswer{
Given a set $M$ with an uncountable subset $A$ we can see that the $M$ is uncountable since any counting of must eventually count all the elements of $A$, which is impossible.
}
\end{Problem}


\begin{Problem}
Let $M$ be any infinite set and $A$ any countable set. Prove that $M ~ M \cup A.$

\problemAnswer{

}
\end{Problem}


\begin{Problem}
Prove that each of the following sets is countable:

%begin{enumerate}
%\item The set of all numbers with two distinct decimal expansions (like 0.50000  and 0.4999 . 
%\item The set of akk rational points in the plane.
%\item The set of all rational intervals.
%\item The set of all polynomials with rational coefficients.
%\end{enumerate}

\problemAnswer{

}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Problem}
A number $\alpha$ is called \textit{algebraic} if it is the roof of a polynomial equation with rational coefficients. Prove that the set of all algebraic numbers is countable.

\problemAnswer{

}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Problem}
Prove the existance of uncountably many \textit{transcendental} numbers.

\problemAnswer{

}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Problem}
Prove that the set of all real functions defined on a set $M$ is of power greater than the power of $M$. In particular, prove that the power of the set of all real functions defined in the unit interval is greater tha \textit{c}. (Use the fact that the set of charachteristic functions on $M$ is equivalent to the set of all subsets of $M$.

\problemAnswer{

}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Problem}
Give an indirect proof of the equivalence of the closed interval $[a,b]$, the open interval $(a,b)$, and the half open interval $(a,b]$ or $[b,a)$.

\problemAnswer{

}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Problem}
Prove that the union of a finite or countable number of set each of power \textit{c} is itself of power \textit{c}.

\problemAnswer{

}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Problem}
Proce that each of the following sets has the power of the continuum:

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item The set of all infinite sequences of positive integers.
	\item The set of all ordered \textit{n}-tuples of real numbers.
	\item The set of all infinite sequences of real numbers.
\end{enumerate}

\problemAnswer{

}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Problem}
Develop a contradiction inherent in the notion of the "set of all sets which are not members of themselves."'
